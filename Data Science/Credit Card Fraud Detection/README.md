This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It involves building and evaluating models to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, I explored the use of two machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

The steps involved in this project include:
1. Data preprocessing and normalization.
2. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Training models and evaluating performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

### Logistic Regression Model
- Precision: 97%
- Recall: 92%
- F1 Score: 95%

### Random Forest Classifier
- Precision: 97%
- Recall: 92%
- F1 Score: 95%

The Random Forest model showed superior performance due to its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.

## File Descriptions

- creditcard.csv: Dataset used for training and testing.

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, etc.).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook CCFD.ipynb and execute the cells.
