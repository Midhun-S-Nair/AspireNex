# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It involves building and evaluating models to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, I explored the use of two machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

The steps involved in this project include:
1. Data preprocessing and normalization.
2. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Training models and evaluating performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

### Logistic Regression Model
- Precision: 97%
- Recall: 92%
- F1 Score: 95%

### Random Forest Classifier
- Precision: 97%
- Recall: 92%
- F1 Score: 95%

The Random Forest model showed superior performance due to its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.
