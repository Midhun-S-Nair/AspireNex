This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset contains information about individual passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

## Project Overview

In this project, I build a model which predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not by training a Random Forest Classifier.

The steps involved in this project include:
1. Data preprocessing and normalization.
2. Handling missing values and converting categorical features to numeric.
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Training models and evaluating performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Validating the model with Cross-Validation.
6. Analyze the importance of the features to understand which features are driving the predictions.

## Results

- Precision: 100%
- Recall: 100%
- F1 Score: 100%

The Random Forest model showed superior performance due to its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.

## File Descriptions

- CCFD.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- creditcard.csv: Dataset used for training and testing.

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, etc.).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook CCFD.ipynb and execute the cells.
