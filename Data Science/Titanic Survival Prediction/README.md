This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset contains information about individual passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the dataset file `titanic.csv`.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, cleaning, and modeling.
