This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset contains information about individual passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

## Project Overview

In this project, I build a model which predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not by training a Random Forest Classifier.

The steps involved in this project include:
1. Data preprocessing and normalization.
2. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Training models and evaluating performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
